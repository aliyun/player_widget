### **4.2 Implement Video Playback**
Below is a complete example demonstrating how to embed a video player into a page. With just a few lines of code, you can achieve video playback functionality.
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aliplayer_widget/aliplayer_widget_lib.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: VideoPlayerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerPageState createState() => _VideoPlayerPageState();
}

class _VideoPlayerPageState extends State<VideoPlayerPage> {
  late AliPlayerWidgetController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the player component controller
    _controller = AliPlayerWidgetController(context);
    // Configure the player component data
    final data = AliPlayerWidgetData(
      videoUrl: "https://example.com/video.mp4", // Replace with actual video URL
      coverUrl: "https://example.com/cover.jpg", // Replace with actual cover image URL
      videoTitle: "Sample Video",
    );
    _controller.configure(data); // Set autoplay
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Destroy the player instance to release resources
    _controller.destroy();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: AliPlayerWidget(
          _controller,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
**Key Points Analysis**
1. **Initialize `AliPlayerWidgetController`**:
   - Create `_controller` instance within the `initState` method.
2. **Call `configure` Interface**:
   - Use `AliPlayerWidgetData` to configure video URL, cover image, title, and other information.
   - Call `_controller.configure(data)` to pass data to the player component.
3. **Release Resources**:
   - Call `_controller.destroy()` within the `dispose` method to avoid memory leaks.

**Support for More Scenarios**
The above example demonstrates basic usage for VOD scenarios. For more complex scenarios (e.g., live streaming, playlist playback), refer to the `aliplayer_widget_example` sample project, which includes detailed code and usage instructions.
